## Usage Examples

```python
# Hardware-optimized configuration
from src.config import get_device, get_batch_size, print_system_info

print_system_info()  # Show hardware capabilities
device = get_device()  # Get optimal device
batch_size = get_batch_size(default=32, memory_factor=0.8)

# Robust computation
from src.robust_computation import safe_divide, execute_with_retries, memory_monitor

# Safe mathematical operations
result = safe_divide(numerator, denominator)  # Handles division by zero

# Retry logic for operations
result = execute_with_retries(risky_operation, *args, **kwargs)

# Memory monitoring
with memory_monitor():
    # Memory-intensive computation
    pass

# Streaming for large datasets
from src.robust_computation import stream_batches

for batch in stream_batches(large_dataset, batch_size=32):
    # Process batch with automatic memory management
    pass
```
