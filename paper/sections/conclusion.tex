We presented a causal-faithfulness metric that yields standardized, interpretable scores and aligns with intervention semantics. Across SST-2 and WikiText-2, $\Fscore$ clearly separates informed from random explainers, with strong statistical support and bootstrap uncertainty quantification. Correlations with ROAR further support validity, and theoretical figures illustrate monotonicity and normalization. We release code, configurations, and artifacts to facilitate full reproducibility.

Looking ahead, we aim to extend masking operators, study structured features, and broaden cross-modal validation. We hope $\Fscore$ serves as a principled, practical standard for evaluating explanation faithfulness.
